#### B-Motivation
B-1 Need: We all know about the coral reef issue but we do not have a a detailed knowledge about  the causes of it, especially land-based causes and what we could do to improve the situation. 
B-2 Competition: For what we know, it is the first ontology on the subject.
B-3 Target audience: It concerns everyone who wants to know more about coral reef destruction and to act against it. 
#### C-Scope, requirements, development community
C-1 Scope and coverage: from the site https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/coral-pollution.html.
C-2 Development community: National Ocean Service.
C-3 Communication: jeanjules.bigeard@gmail.com.
#### D-Knowledge acquisition
D-1 Knowledge acquisition methodology: from the graph. https://aamboceanservice.blob.core.windows.net/oceanservice-prod/facts/coral-pollution.pdf.
D-2 Source knowledge location: from the site https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/coral-pollution.html.
D-3 Content selection: The content is detailed in the transcript of the document we used.
#### E-Ontology content
E-1 Knowledge representation language: We used OWL version 2.
E-2 Development environment: Protege 5.5.0.
E-3 Ontology metrics: This info is available in the part 7-/ of the ontology report.
E-4 Incorporation of other ontology: None.
E-5 Entity naming convention: Naming convention is available in the ontology report.
E-6 Identifier generation policy: Using suffix TODO for action to take.
E-7 Entity metadata policy: Each class have a textual definition as comment.

#### F-Managing change
F-1 Sustainability plan: No particular sustainability plan.
F-2 Entity deprecation strategy: Deprecated classes should be labeled as obsolete with an annotion.
F-3 Versioning policy: For now XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
#### G-Quality assurance
G-1 Testing: Thanks to the ontology, we had a better view on the problem and how each land-based activity is acting on the coral reef and precisely how it is acting on it.
G-2 Evaluation: Visualization on the OwlViz plugin offer a way to check if our ontology is coherent with our support information.
G-3 Example of use: An example of use is to check which activities are the most harmful for the coral reef or which ones are the less well known to produce focus awareness campaign. 
G-4 Institutional endorsement: None
G-5 evidence of use: None but an awareness campaign using the less well known activities and the most harmful is a good idea.
